DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS,

LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  IN ANY CASE, THE ASKYWHALE GROUP'S 
ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS 
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE 
FEES LICENSEE PAID FOR THIS LICENSE (IF ANY) AND FEES FOR 
SUPPORT OF THE PRODUCT RECEIVED BY ASKYWHALE UNDER A 
SEPARATE SUPPORT AGREEMENT (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OF 
DEFECTIVE MEDIA OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR 
PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT ASKYWHALE'S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE 
NEGLIGENCE OF ASKYWHALE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES.  SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF

EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE.  
ADDITIONALLY, THE ASKYWHALE GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR

11. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  The Product is not fault-tolerant and

machines, or weapons systems ("High Risk Activities").  
ACCORDINGLY, ASKYWHALE AND ITS SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCT IN 
SUCH APPLICATIONS.

12. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that, 
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any breach or 
threatened breach of this Agreement by Licensee shall cause Askywhale 
irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be 
inadequate and that askywhale therefore may seek and obtain timely 
injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Agreement in addition 
to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.
